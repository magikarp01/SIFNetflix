# SIFNetflix
Analyzing the SIF Netflix Dataset.

I did aspects of the analysis separately at first, in the read_dataset.py, regression.py, and reviews.py.

I aggregated all the code and did a lot more work in the SIF_Netflix_Dataset_Analysis.ipynb, which I made using Google Colab. 
That notebook has all of the code used to do analysis/make graphics for my paper submission.
